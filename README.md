# Bike-Sharing-Demand
Bike Sharing systems are a means of renting  bicycles where the process of obtaining  membership, rental, and bike return is  automated via a network of kiosk locations  throughout a city. Using these systems,  people are able rent a bike from a one  location and return it to a different place on  an as-needed basis. Bike sharing is an  emerging urban transportation option based  on collective paid use of public bicycles  available at distributed stations.
