Bike Sharing systems are a means of renting  bicycles where the process of obtaining  membership, rental, and bike return is  automated via a network of kiosk locations  throughout a city. Using these systems,  people are able rent a bike from a one  location and return it to a different place on  an as-needed basis. Bike sharing is an  emerging urban transportation option based  on collective paid use of public bicycles  available at distributed stations.


#### Abstract 
Bike Sharing is a sustainable mode of urban mobility, not only for regular commuters but also for casual users and tourists. Bike sharing is an innovative bike sharing model, that saves on start-up cost, prevents bike theft, and offers significant opportunities for smart management by tracking bikes in real time with built-in GPS. The primary objective of this paper is to understand the mobility patterns and imbalance of a bike sharing by analyzing its historical trip and weather data. Resulting outcomes provide insights to assist the system operator to make more informed decisions. Researchers have studied mobility patterns by analyzing historical trip and weather data of station-based bike sharing systems using data visualization and or generalized linear models. However, none of these studies considered interaction between independent variables or study imbalance as a dependent variable.Rental Bike Sharing is the process by which bicycles are procured on several basis- hourly, weekly, membership wise, etc. This phenomenon has seen its stock rise to considerable levels due to a global effort towards reducing the carbon footprint, leading to climate change, unprecedented natural disasters, ozone layer depletion, and other environmental anomalies.

### Introduction:
Public bike-sharing systems were suggested at the beginning of the millennium but have been gaining momentum only in the last decade. The main premise of implementing bike-sharing systems is to promote sustainable mobility in urban areas. They offer a convenient and easy-to-use service for residents for short-distance trips. Moreover, they are capable to improve first/last mile connection to other travel modes, reduce traffic congestion and energy consumption and decrease environmental impacts of daily travels. Furthermore, communities who organize a bike-sharing program increase physical activity and encourage remarkable health benefits to the users. Bike-sharing system as a sustainable and affordable travel mode is not without its challenges for both users, e.g., perceived lack of safety, and operators. In this context, bike repositioning or rebalancing has been recognized as an important operational challenge.Bike demand is basically non-stationary, meaning that it varies over time and space. The fluctuating demand may cause the uneven distribution of bikes across different stations where some stations may be totally saturated while concurrently others may lack bikes. This can be related to the “tidal flows” of bikesharing trips, with certain areas in the city encountering a deficit of bike availability. For instance, during the morning rush hour, residential areas generate a high number of commuting trips towards the areas of employment. This could possibly lead to the problem of insufficient bikes in those areas in that period.

### ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS 
  #### 1. Reduction in Emissions.
Increased cycling offers many environmental benefits for a community. For every mile driven, cars produce almost a pound of CO2. Considering that 40% of all car trips are less than two miles (i.e. very bike able), the savings in pollutants emitted could be substantial. A person who cycles to a job four miles away saves approximately 2,000 miles of driving and 2,000 lbs. of CO2 emissions each year. This equates to nearly a 5% reduction in the average American’s carbon footprint.

  #### 2. Bike Shares Have Minimal Carbon Footprint.
The bike share stations under consideration for Dayton are solar powered, therefore they have a minimal carbon footprint. Additionally, some systems use bike pulled trailers to help with redistribution of bikes, so even the operations can be environmentally friendly.
